# Roman Numerals

Write a function that converts a number to it's roman equivalent. 

>1 -> I

>10 -> X

>7 -> VII

There is no need to be able to convert numbers larger than about 3000. (The Romans themselves didnâ€™t tend to go any higher).


You can find detailed rules about specific conversion cases, but here are the most general ones: 
>I - > 1

>V -> 5

>X -> 10

>L -> 50

>C -> 100

>D -> 500

>M -> 1000

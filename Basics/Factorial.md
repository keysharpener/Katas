# [Factorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial)

### Code an algorithm returning the factorial of a given number.

``` 
f(x) = x * (x-1) * (x-2) * ... * 2 * 1
```

Example:

```csharp
int result = Factorial(15);
result == 1307674368000;
```
***Hint:*** There are two ways to implement this. With and without recursion. Try both ways

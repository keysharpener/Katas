# Palindromes

### Write a method that detects palindromes

In the English language, a palindrome is a word, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward. 

Your goal is to write a method which returns true if the word is a palindrome, false otherswise. It should ***not*** be case sensitive.

Usage examples :

```csharp
bool result = IsPalindrome("madam");
result == true;

bool result = IsPalindrome("Madam");
result == true;

bool result = IsPalindrome("Mister");
result == false;
```
